This page hosts the Supplementary Materials of Paper:  **  To What Extent Do DNN-based Image Classification Models Make Unreliable Inferences?**

The paper is accepted by the Journal: Empirical Software Engineering

Feel free to contact the author if you have any questions. 


## Source code
Please see the folder `source_code`.

The implementation of our approach is not hard. 
We upload our implementation for your reference.
Let us know if you have any questions.

## Data
The basic data is in the folder `csv_file`.
These files are generated by the `analyze_result.py`.

The raw experiment data is in npz format.
It is relative large (>100MB) and we are looking for some places to store it.
Let us know if anything you want but has not appear in this website. 
We will try to figure out a way to share a copy with you somehow.

Besides, we have all the checkpoints (~100 epochs for each model) in the training of the PyTroch ResNet50 and VGG16.
They are in huge size (>10 GB) and we cannot share it here.
Training it is very time-consuming.
Let us know if you want to have a copy for your research.

### Notice
The supplementary data of our first submission now moves to in the folder ``csv_file_archive``.
It is only for archive. 
Please do not use it any more.
